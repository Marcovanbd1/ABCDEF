<h1>A small idea that could make digital health platforms much more powerful</h1>

<p class="lead">
Most digital health tools help clinicians communicate, document, triage, or coordinate.
</p>

<p class="lead">
Very few help people understand what to do next.
</p>

<p>
That gap matters more than it looks. Because confusion is one of the biggest hidden drivers of demand.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The missing layer</h2>

<p>
Support Playlists are personalised guidance paths generated from what someone says they need.
</p>

<p class="lead">
Support Playlists start with voice, and fall back to text.
</p>

<p>
Not search results.<br>
Not static signposting.<br>
Not generic advice.
</p>

<p>
They translate a person’s situation into a tailored set of next steps, drawing from local, national and digital support options.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>In simple terms:</strong><br>
They help people reach the right help sooner, and with more confidence.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why this matters for platforms</h2>

<p>
Most platforms currently optimise for interaction.
</p>

<p>
Messaging. Forms. Notes. Tasks. Triage.
</p>

<p>
Those are essential.
</p>

<p>
But there’s another layer that sits just outside them:</p>

<p class="lead">
Navigation.
</p>

<p>
If people don’t know where they’re going, even the best systems still receive misdirected demand.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Where Support Playlists fit</h2>

<p>
They don’t replace platforms.<br>
They strengthen them.
</p>

<p>
They can sit alongside existing tools and act as a guidance layer that:
</p>

<p>
• reduces unnecessary contacts<br>
• improves pathway alignment<br>
• supports prevention<br>
• increases confidence<br>
• reduces explanation time<br>
• improves experience on both sides
</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p>
Platforms help clinicians do things.<br>
Support Playlists help people understand things.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why now</h2>

<p>
Health systems everywhere are shifting:
</p>

<p>
From hospital to community<br>
From analogue to digital<br>
From treatment to prevention
</p>

<p>
Those shifts only work if people can navigate support before they escalate into services.
</p>

<p class="lead">
Navigation is becoming infrastructure.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The bigger pattern</h2>

<p>
Support Playlists are part of a wider neighbourhood-level model designed to help systems:
</p>

<p>
notice pressure earlier<br>
respond sooner<br>
and keep people supported outside clinical pathways when appropriate
</p>

<p>
That wider model is explained here:

<h2>Why I’m sharing this</h2>

<p>
People building digital health platforms are in a unique position.
</p>

<p>
You already have scale, trust, and workflow presence.
</p>

<p>
Adding navigation intelligence doesn’t require replacing what exists.
</p>

<p class="lead">
It simply makes what exists more useful.
